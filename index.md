## Welcome to a preview of the Hautavenka site.

This will be the landing page for whatever Karl and Kristi want this site to be for.

### Some Ideas

1. A blog about Precious the Toad.
2. Research paper publishings.
3. A place to store latest music recordings.

4. A place to list off your skills as a slick landing page.
5. A url to place on your business card.
6. Have a subdomain for karl.hautavenka.com and a subdomain for kristi.hautavenka.com.
7. You have to come up with this one.
8. A place to share pictures you took that isn't owned by Facebook.

Cheers,
Mario
